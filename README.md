- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @searsm8
- I'm a PhD student at UT Dallas studying FPGA implementation, tools, and algorithms.
- Right now I'm working on a software tool for rapid implementation of DNNs, which takes a ML convolutional network defined in python and takes the design all the way to implementation on an FPGA.
- You can email me at mark.sears@utdallas.edu
